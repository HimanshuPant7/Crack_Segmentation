# Crack_Segmentation
This repository contains code for the segmentation of cracks present in concrete bodies.

## **Description**
The goal of this project is to develop a crack segmentation model for concrete structures. The segmentation model takes an input image of a crack in a concrete body and outputs a binary mask where cracks are identified. The code provided here consists of two main parts: Preprocessing of the image and Segmentation of the crack.

### **Preprocessing**
The preprocessing code is implemented in the file "Concise_postprocessing_code.ipynb". Follow the steps below to preprocess the data:
1. Open the "Concise_postprocessing_code.ipynb" file in your Colab notebook.
2. Run the steps from 0 to 3 to preprocess the data.

### **CNN Model**
The CNN model for crack segmentation is implemented in the file "Deep_crack.ipynb". Follow the steps below to run the CNN model:
1. Open the "Deep_crack.ipynb" file.
2. Run the code in the notebook to predict the cracks.
3. Come back to the "Concise_postprocessing_code.ipynb" code and run the remaining steps i.e. 5 and 6.
